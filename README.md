# Weather Calendar App
Project presents responsive calendar app. The project is made "for fun" to test my React.js skills. My aim was to present in convinient way today's date and weather report and the view of current month with next 16-day weathercast. The app uses unsplash API (https://unsplash.com/documentation) to display background image corresponding to the today's weather forecast (https://www.weatherbit.io/api).
Look at demo here: http://kot.vot.pl/weather_calendar/

P.S. If you do not see the background photo it means there was more than 50 requests per last hour and you need to wait (totally worth it of course) :) - free Api version.
